I would desire and find it easy to give advice on sexual inexperience in romantic relationships because I desire and find it easy to give advice to others, when asked, about romantic relationships.  I desire and find it easy to give advice to others, when asked, about romantic relationships because I desire and find it easy to give advice in general. I desire and find it easy to give advice in general because I am comfortable sharing my own experiences and presenting them to another in a way that they might serve as advice-by-example of how someone else has dealt with a similar issue and to remind the advice-asker that they are not alone in their struggle.   2. I chose sexual inexperience over honesty because  it seemed to me that the problem and the sample letter would be more interesting. I felt this because 'sexual inexperience' seemed to me to be a far more specific scenario than the more general theme of 'honesty.' Therefore, relatively speaking, I felt it would be more desirable and more interesting to read and write a response to an advice-seeking testimony on 'sexual inexperience' than 'honesty.'  3. The nefarious side of me rejected a request for help pertaining to 'honesty' in relationships because I believe, on a very base and prejudiced level, that only dishonesty can engender dishonesty. I was inclined to blame the victim for having problems with 'honesty' (yes, without actually even having read their request) and reject their inferred request for advice in favor of answering one on 'sexual experience,' a question which seems (to the base and prejudiced me) to come from a standpoint of innocence and true need for advice or guidance."	"1. It is never easy to give advice because it requires a great deal of effort to maintain respect, at all times, for the specificity of the asker's situation. As an advice-giver, I usually expend some effort making sure that I do not overstep the boundary from offering advice in the form of giving options or offering my own experiences as example, to actually attempting to instruct the asker in what their course of action 'should' be. It is difficult to maintain the impartiality necessary to advise well. You must always respect the autonomy of the asker, and realize that the intactness of their own feelings and decision-making is more important than what you would do or what you wish they would do. I feel this respect is especially important, and thereby especially difficult to protect, in situations which involve another person's sexual sense of well-being.   2. For me, it could be difficult to give advice on this topic because I experienced fear of 'sexual inexperience' in a very different way, I think, than this asker. I usually base my advice on offering up my own experiences in the matter to see if the asker can extrapolate any useful knowledge from them, but in this case I would have difficulty relating my experiences to the asker's since my fears regarding sexual inexperience were based more on loss of innocence/virginity while it seems the asker's were related more to self-image. Then again, these things really relate when boiled down to their essential parts.   3. Because as much as I want to be an open-minded person and be able to respond to all inquiries for advice, there are also some things I just would rather not know about other people. Fears about sexual inexperience could probably make that list for me. Probably because  I have my own fears about people who have fears about sexual inexperience.

I think honesty is also involved with these issues because young people especially can be very uncomfortable voicing their sexual preferences and making their needs known to the other person. Helping people realize that the other person probably feels similarly about the sexual experiences always helps people to move past their nervousness and address the issue with their partner. "	"Everyone is different. The array of different kinds of sexual experiences are so varied that, with this kind of advice, you really need to be open-minded and non-judgmental.
